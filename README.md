## To Do
- why is there smooth travel between points inside this blog post (https://www.mapbox.com/blog/worldview-3-live-mapbox-satellite/) compared to direct link to same content (https://www.mapbox.com/bites/00045/)?

- add comment REMINDER that geojson coordinates are lng,lat NOT lat,lng
- can we make geojson boundaries appear/disappear with slide scroll?
