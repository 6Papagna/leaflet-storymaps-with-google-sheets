## Credits

## To Do
- continue to test markers versus pulse versions
- test whether I can create in pure Leaflet without Mapbox
- find way to insert photos into markers version that will automatically resize (as they do in pulse version)
- why is there smooth panning between points inside this blog post (https://www.mapbox.com/blog/worldview-3-live-mapbox-satellite/) compared to direct link to same content (https://www.mapbox.com/bites/00045/)?
- see also smooth panning transitions in http://www.digital-geography.com/create-storymap/

- add comment REMINDER that geojson coordinates are lng,lat NOT lat,lng
- can we make geojson boundaries appear/disappear with slide scroll?
